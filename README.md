## serverless-ts project with following:
  1. serverless-ts  
  2. node-ts [typescript with class support]
  3. backend as dynamodb with relational support [designed multiple tables to one with GSIs]  
  4. dependency injection [just like the way we do in C#, JAVA projects; used microsoft tsyringe]
  5. one can run locally [serverless-offline, dynamodb-offline]
  6. least but not least having tslint for clean code
